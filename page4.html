<h1>Looking Ahead</H1>
<H2>My future Plans and Aspirations</H2>
<h4> In High School, I experimented with starting my own small business. With access to a sublimation printer
and vinyl cutter, I created custom clothing with a group of friends, and sold them to my fellow classmates. Each member of the team was spending 5 hours a week 
working on designs, and producing the clothing. Using wholesale clothing dealers, we were able to purchase the materials needed for a low price.</h4>
<h4> After Graduating, we stopped producing clothing, however, I look forward to using this trade in the near future to create a social media page to showcase 
my designs.</h4>
<h4> During the past summer, I entered in three downhill mountain biking races at Highland Mountain Bike Park. </h4>
<h4> Although I did not win the competitions, I am extremely motivated to train for next years season, and reenter the races.</h4>
