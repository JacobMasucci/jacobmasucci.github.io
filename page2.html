<h1>Mountain Biking</H1>
<H2>My Athletic Background</H2>
</center>
<center>
<h4>My mountain biking carrer began at an early age, my father introduced me to the sport, which eventually
grew into my passion. 
 Growing up in Winchester gave me the ability to harness my talent, and 
meet many great people in the local community.</h4>
<h4> Taking frustrations with the world and using those emotions in a constructive manner, I believe is one of the "keys to happiness". Although peoples
passions differ, it is important to find a passion that can change your life</h4>
<h4> I am often asked, Why do I constantly 
risk my health participating in such a dangerous sport?</h4>
<h4>One of the most indescribable feelings is finding a true passion. When trying to learn a trick, the pain of crashing, and the fear of rolling 
up to an intimidating feature pails in comparison to the feeling of landing a trick that I have spent hours, days, or years trying to learn.</h4>
<h4> I find the risk involved to be one of the best aspects of the sport. Challenge and risk motivates me to push my limits. 
Every time I crash or fall, I learn something about myself. 
I learn that I can do the "impossible". It's a feeling that I can't express through any form of communication, there 
is so many heavy emotions involved in learning a trick, that you must experience the feeling for yourself to understand.</h4>
